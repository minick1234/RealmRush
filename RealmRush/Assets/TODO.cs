     * This is not necessariy a script or anything this is a small place for what i would like to do next / fix
     *
     * On the completion of this tutorial i will fill this out alot more but as of right now there is not alot i can put since i will need to see what he has planned and implements
     * although the one thing i do want to for sure implement is the turrets to shoot differently
     * the way i want it to work is that the turret focuses on the item that came within its sphere and it checks the first objects that came into that range, it continues to be the same object until it fully leaves range.
     * the next object is then assigned this way they have priority on the object that is always first in the row and that way for example if we have a situation when they make it to the end of the run and the turret can stop them from entering
     * but he sees a target rn closer he shoots that when instead he should focus on the other turret at the very front that is still fully within his range.
     *
     * another thing we can do is also to balance out the game a little is by adding so that by each wave of spawning we can make it that if we kill 15 enemies it will half the spawn times by 2 or something.
